# StoreKit

The StoreKit framework provides two APIs for implementing a store in your app and offering in-app purchases:

* [In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase), a Swift-based API that provides Apple-signed transactions in JSON Web Signature (JWS) format, available starting in iOS 15, macOS 12, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8.

* [Original API for In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase), an API that provides transaction information using App Store receipts, available starting in iOS 3, macOS 10.7, tvOS 9, and watchOS 6.2.
