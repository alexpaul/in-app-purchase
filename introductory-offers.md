# Introductory Offers 

> Apps with auto-renewable subscriptions can offer a discounted introductory price, including a free trial, to eligible users. You can make introductory offers to customers who havenâ€™t previously received an introductory offer for the given product, or for any products in the same subscription group.

> Start by setting up introductory offers in App Store Connect. Then, in your app, determine if the user is eligible to receive an introductory offer. When the app queries the App Store for a list of available products, display the introductory pricing if the user is eligible to receive them.
