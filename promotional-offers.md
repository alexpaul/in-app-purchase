# Promotional Offers 

> You can offer a discounted or free period of service for auto-renewable subscription products on macOS, iOS, and tvOS using promotional offers. Limited-time, discounted promotional offers can be effective in winning back lapsed subscribers or retaining current subscribers.

> Before you can provide promotional offers in your app, you must first generate a subscription key and set up the offers in your App Store Connect account.
