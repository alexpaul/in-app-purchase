## Churn (Subscriber Loss)

> To avoid interrupting days of paid service, you can enable Billing ["Grace Period"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/reducing_involuntary_subscriber_churn) in App Store Connect, which allows subscribers to retain full access to your appâ€™s paid content while Apple attempts to collect payment.
