# Grace Period

> iOS 15.4 Release Notes: Users can now test the billing retry and grace period states using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. Use Xcode 13.3 or later to enable billing retry testing and toggle whether the app offers a grace period. Use isInBillingRetry and gracePeriodExpirationDate to handle these states in the app. (83938270)

> Xcode 13.3 Release Notes: You can now toggle a new mode in StoreKit configuration files called Billing Retry on Renewal. This mode causes subscriptions to enter a simulated Billing Retry period when a subscription is set to renew. This mode works on devices and simulators running iOS 15.4, macOS Monterey 12.3, watchOS 8.5, or tvOS 15.4. (83938223)
