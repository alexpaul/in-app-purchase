# Subscription Groups 

A subscription group is a collection of subscription products that has some specific properties.

* No two products in a subscription group can be active at the same time.
* A free trial or introductory price can only be used once per group.
* A subscription group also determines the service level of each product, determining the upgrade/downgrade/crossgrade behavior.
* Subscription groups have localized description data that determine how your app appears in the management menu in the App Store settings.
