# Subscription Groups 

A subscription group is a collection of subscription products that has some specific properties.

* No two products in a subscription group can be active at the same time.
* A free trial or introductory price can only be used once per group.
* A subscription group also determines the service level of each product, determining the upgrade/downgrade/crossgrade behavior.
* Subscription groups have localized description data that determine how your app appears in the management menu in the App Store settings.

> Each subscription you offer must be assigned to a subscription group. A subscription group is made up of subscriptions with different access levels, prices, and durations so people can select the option that best fits their needs. Since people can only buy one subscription within a group at a time, creating a single group is the best practice for most apps as it prevents people from accidentally purchasing multiple subscriptions.
